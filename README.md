- Chatpdf: ChatPDF is the fast and easy way to chat with any PDF, free and without sign-in. Talk to books, research papers, manuals, essays, legal contracts, whatever you have! The intelligence revolution is here, ChatGPT was just the beginning!
- YouChat: YouChat is a chatbot launched by You.com, founded by AI expert Richard Socher. In March 2022, the company introduced YouWrite, a text generator based on GPT-3 that can be used for writing emails and other documents. In December 2022, the company launched the chatbot YouChat based on GPT-3.5. It uses Google search for more general results and Microsoft Bing search to handle more granular requests, such as code snippet searches. Unlike ChatGPT, YouChat's replies include quotes, which can help users track the source of each message.
- Perplexity AI : Perplexity.AI combines large-scale language models and search engines to provide answers to users' needs through continuous dialogue. Compared to ChatGPT, Perplexity AI can provide the sources of information (including Wikipedia, Baidu Baike, Zhihu, etc.), but its answer fluency and completeness are slightly inferior to ChatGPT.
- Chat Simplifier: Chat simplifier, extracts key points from conversations.
- pandaGPT: Assist in reading PDFs and automatically answering questions.

### OpenAI Investments
- edgedb: EdgeDB is a developer of the first open-source graph-relational database.EdgeDB is reinventing the relational database stack. Through a streamlined data model and powerful query language, they make working with data productive, pleasant, and efficient for developers and data engineers. It aims to solve some hard design problems that make existing databases unnecessarily onerous to use.
- Descript: Descript is a collaborative audio and video editor that transcribes audio to a text document for editing. It also provides automated and manual transcribing solutions for voice audio files. In addition, the platform utilizes speech recognition technology to transcribe audio and video files in a short duration of time.
- Ambience Healthcare: Ambience Healthcare's mission is to supercharge healthcare providers with AI superpowers.Our flagship product, Ambience AutoScribe, is a fully automated AI medical scribe that captures the nuances of provider-patient conversation in real-time into a comprehensive note and seamlessly fits into EMR workflows. Adopted by provider organizations across North America, Ambience reduces time spent on documentation by 76% so that providers can focus on what matters most: caring for patients. Ambience AutoScribe is used by providers everyday, even in some of the most challenging medical specialties (e.g., psychiatry and complex geriatric primary care). For the first time in years, our providers are able to get home on time for dinner and don’t need to spend hours late at night catching up on their charts.

### OpenAI Products
- Text
    - chatGPT: a model which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. 
    - GPT: GPT models are capable of natural language processing tasks such as text generation, summarization, and analysis. GPT series involution: GPT-1/GPT-2/GPT-3/Codex/InstructGPT/Code-davinci-002/Text-davinci-002/Text-davinci-003
    - Embedding model: The new model, text-embedding-ada-002, replaces five separate models for text search, text similarity, and code search, and outperforms our previous most capable model, Davinci, at most tasks, while being priced 99.8% lower. 
- Image
    - DALL·E: DALL·E is an AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. 
    - CLIP: Connecting text and images. a neural network called CLIP which efficiently learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. CLIP can be applied to any visual classification benchmark by simply providing the names of the visual categories to be recognized, similar to the "zero-shot" capabilities of GPT-2 and GPT-3.
    - Point-E: A System for Generating 3D Point Clouds from Complex Prompts.
- Audio
    - Whisper: Whisper is a versatile speech recognition model that can transcribe, identify, and translate multiple languages.
    - Jukebox: a neural net that generates music as raw audio in a variety of genres and artist styles.
    - MuseNet:  a deep neural network that can generate 4-minute musical compositions with 10 different instruments.

### Competitors: AI chatbot
- OpenChatKit: A toolkit similar to ChatGPT, based on EleutherAI's GPT-NeoX-20B, containing a large model with 20 billion parameters that has been fine-tuned on 43 million prompts.
- Jasper Chat: A feature in the Jasper AI ecosystem, unlike ChatGPT, it is a paid service.
- Character ai: Founder Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas from Google's LaMDA. Unlike ChatGPT, it categorizes the chatbots into various subfields, offering a diverse range of chatbots to choose from depending on the specific domain, such as celebrities, characters from movies or games, etc. It allows people to participate in the creation process through a platform instead of solely relying on self-creation and model training.
- Poe: Quora has launched an AI chatbot tool similar to ChatGPT. The product currently includes four different bots, namely Sage, Claude, ChatGPT, and Dragonfly, which are somewhat similar to the offerings of Character AI. These bots draw their AI capabilities from various sources, including OpenAI, Anthropic's Claude, and other AI models, making it a product that integrates multiple AI models.
- Bard: Bard is Google's new AI chatbot service that uses LaMDA, a language model that can generate natural and informative responses. Bard can help users with creative tasks, explaining complex topics, and learning new things. Bard is Google's answer to ChatGPT, Microsoft's popular AI chatbot3.
- MOSS: Fudan University's Natural Language Processing Laboratory has launched MOSS5, China's first large-scale conversational language model, capable of performing tasks such as dialogue generation, programming, and fact-based question-answering.

### Competitors:  LLM
- LaMDA: Language Model for Dialogue Applications is a family of conversational large language models developed by Google. LaMDA uses a decoder-only transformer language model.
- LLaMA: by Meta AI , A foundational, 65-billion-parameter large language model. LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is a state-of-the-art foundational large language model designed to help researchers advance their work in this subfield of AI. Smaller, more performant models such as LLaMA enable others in the research community who don't have access to large amounts of infrastructure to study these models, further democratizing access in this important, fast-changing field. 
- Gopher: developed by DeepMind, a 280 billion parameter transformer language model called Gopher, is an autoregressive transformer-based dense LLM — basically
- GLM: GLM is a General Language Model developed by Tsinghua University. It is pretrained with an autoregressive blank-filling objective and can be finetuned on various natural language understanding and generation tasks. GLM-130B is an open bilingual (English&Chinese) version of GLM with 130 billion parameters, designed for users with a single A100 or V100 server23.

- BLOOM: by BigScience, BLOOM is an autoregressive Large Language Model (LLM), trained to continue text from a prompt on vast amounts of text data using industrial-scale computational resources. As such, it is able to output coherent text in 46 languages and 13 programming languages that is hardly distinguishable from text written by humans. BLOOM can also be instructed to perform text tasks it hasn't been explicitly trained for, by casting them as text generation tasks.
- OPT: by Meta, The OPT model was proposed in Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models by Meta AI. OPT is a series of open-sourced large causal language models which perform similar in performance to GPT3.
